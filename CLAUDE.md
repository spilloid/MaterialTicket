# anchordesk — CLAUDE.md

Developer reference for working with this codebase. Keep this document updated as the project evolves.

> **Local tooling note:** the GitHub CLI is installed at `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe` (not on the Git Bash PATH — invoke it by full path, e.g. `"/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI/gh.exe"`). It's authenticated as `spilloid`. Note the token currently lacks `write:packages`, so pushing images to ghcr.io needs a PAT with that scope (or `gh auth refresh -s write:packages`).

## What this is

anchordesk is a **local-first ticketing system** built on Material UI design principles. The local PostgreSQL database is the source of truth; external systems (ConnectWise, IMAP, RMM tools) are sync adapters — not the core.

> **As of 1.1.0:** the database is **PostgreSQL** (was MariaDB) — chosen for `jsonb`, full-text search, and partial indexes. Auth is first-class: **local accounts + OIDC + SAML** with **server-side sessions**, **TOTP MFA (on by default)**, and **RBAC** (admin/technician/readonly). A **Network** view renders probe-discovered devices as a radial map.
>
> **As of 1.6.0:** tickets are a two-way **email conversation** — HTML compose (sanitized) with RFC 5322 threading so replies stay on the ticket; inbound IMAP mail keeps its HTML. The ticket list is **server-paginated** (`GET /tickets` returns `{ items, total, page, pageSize }`, not a bare array) with server-side search/filter and a virtualized table. **Probes link to companies** via `Probe.companyId`, which flows onto discovered devices. Time entries support **duration or start/stop**. MCP gained `log_time` + `send_ticket_email`.
>
> **As of 1.7.0 ("Close the loop"):** three additions complete the daily helpdesk loop.
> - **Attachments** — a pluggable storage seam (`AttachmentStorage` Strategy: `LocalDiskStorage` + `S3Storage` for any S3-compatible store — AWS, MinIO, R2, B2) holds bytes; Postgres holds `Attachment` metadata. Configured via env **or** Admin → Integrations `storage` row (DB wins). Inbound IMAP attachments are persisted; the email composer can attach files. Upload is `@fastify/multipart`; download streams from the row's recorded backend.
> - **Live layer (WebSockets)** — an in-process `eventBus` (Observer, alongside the audit log) publishes `ticket.*` / `note.added` / `sla.atRisk`; `wsHub` fans them over `@fastify/websocket` at `/ws` (session-authed on the upgrade). The web client live-updates lists/Kanban/open ticket and shows a notification bell.
> - **Notifications + SLA** — `notificationService` turns events into per-user `Notification` rows (pushed live). `SlaPolicy` sets response/resolution targets matched by priority/company (precedence: company+priority > company > priority > default); tickets carry `responseDueAt` / `resolutionDueAt` / `firstRespondedAt`, and `slaScheduler` emits at-risk/breach events. Reactive SLA chips render on list/card/board/ticket.
>
> **As of 1.8.0 ("Comms & Craft"):** email becomes multi-identity and the ticket becomes a polished, exportable record.
> - **Email** — Cc/**Bcc**; **send-from identities** (`MailIdentity`: shared boxes like help@/support@ + per-user aliases) set the From header while the SMTP envelope/auth stay the relay (SPF/DKIM intact); per-user **signatures** (`User.signatureHtml`) + reusable **templates** (`MailTemplate`); composer has contact **autocomplete** for To/Cc/Bcc. Pasted/dropped composer images upload to the ticket and are sent as inline `cid:` parts so external clients render them.
>   - **Relay caveat:** because the header From is the chosen identity while the envelope sender stays the authenticated SMTP account, the relay must allow sending as that address (normal for same-domain aliases). If it enforces sender == auth-user it will reject the send; `routes/mail.ts` turns a 5xx relay rejection on a chosen identity into a clear 422 ("relay may not permit this From") rather than a bare 502.
> - **Labels** (`Label` + `TicketLabel`) — managed tags; **mailboxes auto-apply a label** (`Mailbox.labelId`) so catchall vs help@ vs personal inboxes land tagged differently; `GET /tickets?labelId=` filters.
> - **Inline images** — inbound `cid:` images are stored as attachments and rewritten to `/api/attachments/:id/download`; the sanitizer allows stored/relative image URLs + `loading`; the timeline renders HTML for internal notes too (script logs, images) with `max-width`/lazy so layout never breaks.
> - **Script logs** — a finished `ScriptJob` with a `ticketId` appends its output to the timeline as a note (streams in live).
> - **Ticket export** — `GET /tickets/:id/export` returns a self-contained printable HTML doc (activity + images inlined as data URIs) for Print → PDF.
> - **Fuzzy search** — `pg_trgm` trigram similarity combined with FTS, across ticket text + priority + ticket number + note bodies (`ticketRepository.search`, indexes in `pgExtras`).
> - **Modal polish** — ticket-field edits show a live saving → saved/failed indicator.
>
> **As of 1.9.0 ("Thread & Signal"):** public ticket identity and integration operations are consistent end to end.
> - **Ticket numbering** — generated 4–6 digit `ticketNumber` values are independent of row IDs and render across cards, table, Kanban, dialog, search, exports, and tagged outbound subjects.
> - **Mail threading hardening** — outbound mail adds `[#NNNNN]`; inbound IMAP falls back to that subject token when RFC threading headers disappear. Message-ID columns are `varchar(255)` and bounded external strings are clamped before writes.
> - **Sync operations** — provider create/delete/toggle/run is available in the Sync view, with reusable provenance badges on tickets.
> - **Live Tactical panel** — `/devices/:id/live` fetches current Tactical agent state when a linked ticket opens.
> - **Operational safety** — positive-integer route parsing rejects NaN IDs, integration settings seed from env, and SOPS supports deployment secrets.

Key design goals:
- Excellent standalone ticketing experience first
- Sync to/from external platforms second
- Strong SOLID + GoF patterns at integration boundaries
- Full audit log on every mutation (revision history)

## Architecture

```
web-client (React + MUI)
     │  /api/* proxied by Vite dev server → backend:8060
     ▼
backend (Fastify + TypeScript)
     │  Prisma ORM  ·  auth (local/OIDC/SAML + sessions + RBAC)
     ▼
PostgreSQL :5432  ← source of truth
     │
  sync providers
     ├── ConnectWiseProvider  (reads/writes CW Manage)
     ├── NetVizProvider       (probe → device ingest)
     ├── TacticalRmmProvider  (device sync + script runner)
     └── ImapProvider         (planned)
```

GoF patterns in use:
- **Strategy** — `TicketProvider`, `DeviceProvider`, and `ScriptRunner` interfaces (see `src/providers/`, `src/runners/`)
- **Repository** — `src/repositories/` wraps all Prisma queries; routes never touch Prisma directly
- **Observer (append-only log)** — every mutation goes through `auditRepository.record()` before responding

### Auth flow (1.1.0)
- `middleware/auth.ts` runs on every request. It resolves a **session cookie** (browser login), a **personal access token** (`Authorization: Bearer adk_…`, resolved locally — see below), or an **OIDC bearer token** (API clients) to a `request.user` carrying a role, then enforces baseline RBAC (`readonly` can't mutate). `requireRole('admin')` gates admin surfaces. Public paths: `/ping`, `/probe/*`, and the `/auth/*` login endpoints.

### Personal access tokens / MCP auth
- **Personal access tokens (PATs)** let credential-limited programmatic clients — the **MCP voice agent** being the motivating case — authenticate *as a real user*. Users mint/revoke their own from the account menu (**API tokens**); the raw `adk_…` token is shown once and only its SHA-256 hash is stored (`ApiToken`, mirrors `Session`). A PAT carries the owner's role, so RBAC is unchanged. Minting is gated to interactive logins (a token can't farm more tokens); admins may revoke anyone's. Service: `services/auth/apiTokens.ts`; routes: `routes/apiTokens.ts`.
- **Audit attribution** stays the real user, tagged with the channel they came through: `actorFor(username, channel)` yields `alice` (web), `alice (api)` (token REST), or `alice (mcp)` (MCP). The actor flows via `request.actorSub`, so every existing repository audit records the right person + channel with no route changes. The MCP server is built per SSE connection bound to that connection's user (`buildMcpServer(actor)`) — MCP mutations are no longer a flat `'mcp'`.
- **Connecting MCP:** point an SSE client at `/mcp/sse` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (see `.mcp.json`, which reads `${ANCHORDESK_TOKEN}`). The `/mcp/*` endpoints are *not* public — they require a valid PAT (or a session). With `OIDC_DISABLED=true` (dev) every request is the dev admin, including MCP.
- Login flows live in `routes/auth.ts` → services in `services/auth/` (`password`, `sessions`, `oidcService`, `samlService`, `totp`, `authConfig`, `bootstrap`).
- Auth config is seeded from env on first boot into the `auth_settings` row, then editable from **Admin → Authentication** (DB wins). Secrets are write-only over the API.

## Local dev setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 18, npm
- Docker + Docker Compose

### 1. Start the database

```bash
docker compose up -d db adminer
```

Adminer (DB browser) runs at http://localhost:8081 — server `db`, user `stadmin`, db `anchordesk`.

### 2. Configure the backend

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env — at minimum set DATABASE_URL and OIDC_DISABLED=true for local dev
```

### 3. Run Prisma migrations

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma db push        # push schema to DB (dev workflow — no migration files)
npx prisma studio         # optional: visual DB browser at localhost:5555
```

### 4. Start backend and frontend

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd backend && npm start

# Terminal 2
cd web-client && npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at http://localhost:5173 — all `/api/*` requests proxy to backend:8060.

### 5. Full Docker stack (production-like)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Services: frontend :5173, backend :8060, PostgreSQL :5432, Adminer :8081.

> **Logging in:** with `OIDC_DISABLED=true` every request runs as a dev admin (no login screen). For a real login, set `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET` + `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` — the first boot creates a local admin; MFA enrollment is then required on first sign-in (set `MFA_REQUIRED=false` to skip).

## Adding a new sync provider

See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md).

Short version:
1. Create `backend/src/providers/YourProvider.ts` implementing `TicketProvider`
2. Add your provider type to the `ProviderType` enum in `prisma/schema.prisma`
3. Insert a row into `sync_providers` with your config JSON
4. Wire it into the sync service (Phase 3)

---

## Running tests

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && npm test

# Frontend
cd web-client && npm test
```

Backend tests use **ts-jest** (`backend/jest.config.js`). The security-critical auth primitives are covered in `backend/src/services/auth/__tests__/` (password hashing, TOTP, recovery codes) plus the NetViz normalizer and the auth serializers/guards — all DB-free unit tests. New DB-touching tests should target the repositories/routes.

---

## Database schema changes

Always use `prisma db push` in dev (fast iteration, no migration files). When ready for a stable migration:

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name describe_your_change
```

Migration files live in `backend/prisma/migrations/`.
