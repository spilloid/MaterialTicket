# Changelog

## 1.13.0 — 2026-06-27 — Clear Deck (minor)

### Added

- **Advanced search with regex.** The ticket filter panel becomes an **Advanced search** with a case-insensitive **POSIX regular expression** field matched server-side across title, summary, description, company, ticket number, and priority — alongside the existing status / company / assignee / label facets and a new **include-closed** toggle. Invalid patterns are validated client-side and rejected with a clean **400** (Postgres `2201B`, unwrapped from Prisma's `P2010`) rather than a 500.
- **Fall-off close animation.** Each Kanban card has a hover **Close** action; closing plays a tip-and-drop animation as the card falls off the board.

### Changed

- **A board built for live work.** **"Closed" is no longer a Kanban column.** Closed tickets are hidden from the default working views (board, cards, table) and surfaced on demand via the advanced-search *include closed* toggle (a Closed column reappears only when closed tickets are actually loaded, so they're never orphaned). The board now **fills the page width** with no horizontal scrolling.
- **Denser ticket cockpit.** The ticket modal was tightened to stop wasting space: status + priority share one row, card padding is reduced, and every field (status, priority, contact, assignee, labels) uses a consistent floating-label control matching the company picker.
- **No flash on background refresh.** List views only blank to a spinner on the first load; live WebSocket updates, an optimistic close, and drag-between-columns now swap data in place instead of flashing the board out.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate / wedged IMAP ingest.** Email-to-ticket is now **idempotent on Message-ID**. The same message delivered to two monitored mailboxes (one Message-ID, two deliveries) or replayed on a re-poll no longer hits the `(external_id, external_provider)` unique index — which previously threw `P2002`, failed the whole poll, and wedged the mailbox on a "poison" message because `lastUid` never advanced. Duplicates are skipped (and counted in the poll log); a residual collision recovers by appending to the existing ticket.
- **Opaque IMAP errors.** A failed poll now surfaces ImapFlow's real reason (`responseText` / `serverResponseCode` / `authenticationFailed`) in the log and the mailbox's last error, instead of a bare `Command failed`.

## 1.12.0 — 2026-06-26 — Clockwork (minor)

### Added

- **My Day** — a per-tech day-spread of logged time (new **Time → My Day** nav). Windowed time entries sit on a vertical clock with overlap-aware lane packing; the unlogged spans between them render as labelled **gap bands** so holes in the day pop. Duration-only entries get a side tray and still count toward the total. Day nav, a live "now" line, and a logged-vs-gap summary; clicking a block opens the ticket. New endpoint `GET /me/time-entries` (client sends local day bounds so the day respects the tech's timezone).
- **Company-scoped device linking.** A ticket's "Link a device" picker is scoped to the ticket's company so another company's hardware can't be mis-associated; unassigned devices stay visible, with a **"show all companies (N hidden)"** escape hatch.
- **Network → company association.** Admin → Devices gains an inline **Company** column to assign/clear a device's company (via existing `PATCH /devices/:id`; no schema change).

### Fixed

- **Email-signature editor crash.** Account → Email signature crashed the page. The editor passed `editorProps: undefined` when no image-upload handler was supplied (the signature case); TipTap v3 builds the ProseMirror view from those props and dies on `dispatchTransaction`. The editor now always passes a props object. Also de-duplicated the `Link` extension (StarterKit v3 bundles it) and set `immediatelyRender: false`.

### Changed

- **Dev proxy host-friendly.** Vite dev proxy target is configurable via `BACKEND_ORIGIN` (defaults to the compose service name `backend`; set `http://localhost:8060` for host dev).

## 1.11.2 — 2026-06-26 — Polish (patch)

### Added

- **Integrations roadmap** in the Sync view — a presentational section showing what's live and what's next, badged honestly. Ticket sync (PSA): ConnectWise Manage (available), Autotask (coming soon). RMM sync: Tactical RMM (available), Datto RMM + ConnectWise Automate (coming soon). No change to existing functionality.
- **Version badge.** The running build version (from `package.json`, baked in at build time) now shows in the account menu — a one-glance answer to "did the deploy land?"

### Fixed

- **Stale UI after deploys.** The web server now sends `Cache-Control: no-store` for the app shell (`index.html`) while keeping fingerprinted `/assets/` cached immutably. New deploys are picked up immediately without a manual hard-refresh or CDN purge.

See [RELEASE_NOTES_v1.11.2.md](RELEASE_NOTES_v1.11.2.md) for the full release notes.

## 1.11.1 — 2026-06-24 — Switchboard (patch)

### Added

- **`internal` note type.** The `NoteType` enum gains `internal` for system/agent-generated internal notes — specifically the AVR phone-agent posting an end-of-call summary via `POST /api/tickets/:id/notes` with `noteType: "internal"`. Previously such a note 500'd on the enum. Internal notes render like standard notes for now.

### Notes

- Pairs with the AVR phone-agent integration, which authenticates as a technician-role service account using a personal access token (1.10.0). The `api` ticket source it uses was already valid.

See [RELEASE_NOTES_v1.11.1.md](RELEASE_NOTES_v1.11.1.md) for the full release notes.

## 1.11.0 — 2026-06-24 — Shipshape

A navigation/UX cleanup of the ticket workspace.

### Added

- **Admin → Interface** settings section with a **Legacy table view** toggle, backed by a new `ui` settings row. Read by any authenticated user (`GET /ui-settings`), written by admins (`PATCH /ui-settings`).

### Changed

- **Kanban is the default view**, and the view switcher leads with Board → Cards.
- **Kanban columns flex to fit the page width** (240px floor; horizontal scroll only when too many statuses to fit) instead of fixed-width columns that always overflowed.
- **Sync is one surface.** The top-level Sync view is the single home for providers, runs, and activity log. Config actions (add/remove/enable a provider) are gated to admins inline; everyone can view and trigger runs. The duplicate **Admin → "Sync Providers"** tab (a strict subset) was removed.
- **Table view is now opt-in "legacy"** — hidden from the switcher unless an admin enables it under Admin → Interface. Board and Cards are the primary views.

See [RELEASE_NOTES_v1.11.0.md](RELEASE_NOTES_v1.11.0.md) for the full release notes.

## 1.10.0 — 2026-06-23 — Keys & Trails

### Added

- **Personal access tokens.** Self-service API tokens (Account menu → API tokens) let programmatic clients that can't do an interactive or OIDC login — the MCP voice agent being the motivating case — authenticate *as a real user*. The raw `adk_…` token is shown once; only its SHA-256 hash is stored. Tokens carry the owner's role (RBAC unchanged), support optional expiry, and are revocable instantly. Minting is restricted to interactive logins; admins can revoke anyone's token.
- **Channel-tagged audit attribution.** Mutations now record the real user plus the channel they came through — `alice` (web), `alice (api)` (token REST), or `alice (mcp)` — so you can see *who* acted and *how*.

### Changed

- **MCP server requires authentication and attributes per user.** `/mcp/sse` is gated behind a personal access token (or session) and the server is built per-connection bound to that user. Send the token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (see `.mcp.json`).

### Fixed

- MCP mutations previously logged under a flat `'mcp'` actor regardless of who connected; they are now attributed to the authenticated user.

See [RELEASE_NOTES_v1.10.0.md](RELEASE_NOTES_v1.10.0.md) for the full release notes.

## 1.9.1 — 2026-06-21

### Added

- `AUTH_ADMIN_EMAILS` allowlist — emails listed here are granted the admin role on every OIDC/SAML login (promotion-only; non-listed users are never demoted).

### Fixed

- Inbound email subject threading no longer re-attaches on a bare `#NNNNN`. Only the bracketed `[#NNNNN]` tag we emit on outbound mail counts, so unrelated subjects ("Invoice #10042", "PO #12345") can't mis-thread a new email onto an existing ticket.

See [RELEASE_NOTES_v1.9.1.md](RELEASE_NOTES_v1.9.1.md) for the full release notes.

## 1.9.0 — 2026-06-21

### Added

- Configurable public ticket-number sequence and UI display across all ticket surfaces.
- Subject-based email threading fallback using `[#NNNNN]`.
- Sync provider create/delete management and reusable sync badges.
- Live Tactical RMM device details on ticket open.
- SOPS-managed integration deployment secrets.

### Changed

- Widened Message-ID-bearing columns to `varchar(255)`.
- Clamped bounded ticket, note, and IMAP values before database writes.
- Ticket exports now use public ticket numbers.
- Local Compose applies the Prisma schema before backend startup.

### Fixed

- Invalid ticket/note route IDs now return HTTP 400 instead of passing `NaN` to Prisma.
- Web container health checks now use IPv4 loopback.
